I’m building a roguelike PvE auto-battler in Unity with a single unit and a 1-of-3 draft upgrade system.

Today I want to make concrete progress on [ONE specific system or problem].

Current state (short):
– Tech: Unity + C#
– What already exists: [brief bullet list]
– What’s missing / painful: [brief]

Give me:

A clear design for this system (minimal but solid)

A suggested data model / class structure

One or two implementation steps I can finish today

Pitfalls I should avoid

Prefer pragmatic solutions over perfect architecture.
