I’m building a roguelike PvE auto-battler in Unity with a single unit and a 1-of-3 draft upgrade system.

Today I want to make concrete progress on [ONE specific system or problem].

Current state (short):
– Tech: Unity + C#
– What already exists:
-- Main menu
-- Splash Screen
-- CombatSystem
-- DraftSystem
-- GameManager
-- UpradeSystem
-- CI/CD Integration (github actions and auto deploy to itch.io)
-- Sentry Integration for errors and logging
-- Testing Mainly EditMode Tests
-- Death Screen/Game Over

– What’s missing / painful:
-- Continue Button
-- Show Stats/Stats UI


Give me:

A clear design for this system (minimal but solid)

A suggested data model / class structure

One or two implementation steps I can finish today

Pitfalls I should avoid

Prefer pragmatic solutions, that have one responsibilty and avoid coupling.
