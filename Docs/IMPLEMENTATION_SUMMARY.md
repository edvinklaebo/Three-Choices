   - Location: `Assets/Scripts/CharacterSelect/`

6. **GameEvents.cs** - Static event system
   - NewRunRequested_Event (Action)
   - CharacterSelected_Event (Action<CharacterDefinition>)
   - Location: `Assets/Scripts/Events/`

### Scripts Modified
1. **RunController.cs**
   - Added: `StartNewRun(CharacterDefinition character)` overload
   - Added: `CreatePlayerFromCharacter()` helper method
   - Maintains backward compatibility with existing `StartNewRun()`
   - Logs: `[Run] Starting run with {character.DisplayName}`

2. **MainMenuController.cs**
   - Added: `newGameButton` field
   - Added: `OnNewGamePressed()` method
   - Fires GameEvents.NewRunRequested_Event
   - Loads CharacterSelectScene
   - Logs: `[MainMenu] New run requested.`

### Assets Created
1. **Placeholder Character Art**
   - `Assets/Art/Characters/bob_placeholder.png`
   - `Assets/Art/Characters/garry_placeholder.png`
   - `Assets/Art/Characters/steve_placeholder.png`
   - All configured as Sprite (2D) with proper Unity meta files

2. **CharacterSelectScene**
   - `Assets/Scenes/CharacterSelectScene.unity`
   - Minimal scene with Main Camera
   - Added to Build Settings (index 2, between MainMenu and GameScene)

### Tests Created
1. **CharacterSelectionTests.cs** (EditMode)
   - Database_HasThreeCharacters
   - Database_GetByIndex_ReturnsCorrectCharacter
   - Database_GetByIndex_ClampsToValidRange
   - Database_GetByIndex_ClampsNegativeToZero
   - Controller_Next_WrapsAround
   - Controller_Previous_WrapsAround
   - Controller_Confirm_FiresCharacterSelectedEvent
   - CharacterDefinition_HasRequiredProperties
   - Location: `Assets/Tests/EditModeTests/`

## 📋 Unity Editor Setup Required

The code implementation is complete, but the following needs to be configured in Unity Editor:

### 1. Create ScriptableObject Assets
- Create CharacterDatabase asset (Right-click → Create → Game → CharacterDatabase)
- Create 3 CharacterDefinition assets for Bob, Garry, and Steve
- Configure their stats and assign portrait sprites
- Add all characters to the database

### 2. Setup CharacterSelectScene UI
- Open CharacterSelectScene
- Create Canvas with:
  - Character Portrait (Image)
  - Character Name (TextMeshPro)
  - Stats Text (TextMeshPro)
  - Previous Button
  - Next Button
  - Confirm Button
- Create CharacterSelectManager GameObject with required components
- Wire all references and button callbacks

### 3. Update MainMenu Scene
- Add "New Game" button to UI
- Assign button reference to MainMenuController

### 4. Verify RunController Setup
- Ensure RunController exists and is marked DontDestroyOnLoad
- Verify VoidEventChannel references are assigned

## 📊 Architecture Compliance

✅ **No God Objects** - Controller is thin, focused on coordination
✅ **Composition over Inheritance** - MonoBehaviours compose behavior
✅ **Decoupled Logic** - Game logic in CharacterDefinition/Database
✅ **Event-Driven** - GameEvents for loose coupling
✅ **ScriptableObjects for Data** - CharacterDefinition and Database
✅ **No Mutable State in ScriptableObjects** - Runtime state in controllers
✅ **EditMode Tests** - All tests are EditMode
✅ **Diagnostic Logging** - Consistent prefixes throughout

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Automated Tests
All tests are in `CharacterSelectionTests.cs`:
- Database behavior (indexing, clamping)
- Controller cycling (wrap-around)
- Event firing on confirmation
- CharacterDefinition properties

Run via: Unity Test Runner → EditMode tab

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] New Game button exists in MainMenu
- [ ] New Game loads CharacterSelectScene
- [ ] ← → keys cycle through characters
- [ ] Character name updates on cycle
- [ ] Character stats update on cycle
- [ ] Portrait updates on cycle
- [ ] Previous button cycles backward
- [ ] Next button cycles forward
- [ ] Enter key confirms selection
- [ ] Confirm button confirms selection
- [ ] Selected character stats appear in GameScene
- [ ] Console shows diagnostic logs at each step

## 📝 Notes

### Placeholder Assets
The current character portraits are copies of the skull icon. Replace with proper character art when available.

### Animation
Current animation is a simple scale punch (0.2s, 0.1 scale increase). Can be enhanced with DOTween or other animation systems.

### Extensibility
To add more characters:
1. Create new CharacterDefinition asset
2. Add to CharacterDatabase
3. No code changes required

### Backward Compatibility
The original `StartNewRun()` method is preserved. The system supports both:
- Direct run start (existing behavior)
- Character selection flow (new behavior)

## 🔒 Security Notes
- No security vulnerabilities introduced
- No user input validation needed (selection index is clamped)
- No network/save system changes
- Event subscribers properly cleaned up

## 📚 Documentation
- Setup guide: `CHARACTER_SELECTOR_SETUP.md`
- Inline code comments follow existing style
- All logging uses consistent prefixes
